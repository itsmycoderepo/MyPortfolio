# Databricks-Mosaic AI: Building GenAI Solutions with Databricks

![alt text](databricksMosaicAI.png)

# Overview
This guide provides a high-level overview of building Generative AI (GenAI) solutions using Mosaic AI on the Databricks platform. It integrates the power of MosaicML's model training tools, acquired by Databricks in 2023, enabling a complete GenAI solution from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring.

# Key Components
# 1. Data Ingestion

- Automate the ingestion of raw data (e.g., PDFs) using Databricks' Auto-loader.
- Clean and store data in Delta Tables for efficient querying and management.
- Implement Unity Catalog for secure data governance.

# 2. Vector Search

- Convert textual data into vector embeddings for semantic search.
- Use Databricks' Vector Search Index to store embeddings and enable fast similarity searches.

# 3. Model Lifecycle Management

- Track and manage models with MLflow, including experiment tracking and model versioning.
- Deploy models using MLflow Model Serving for real-time inference.

# 4. Generative AI Inferences

- Perform real-time similarity searches and use Large Language Models (LLMs) for AI-driven applications such as content generation or Q&A.
- Enable conversational AI through Databricksâ€™ LLM Chat Endpoints.

# 5. Monitoring & Governance

- Use Lakehouse Monitoring to track pipeline performance, model health, and data quality.
- Ensure compliance and security with Unity Catalog, managing permissions and audit trails across data and models.

# Why Databricks?
Unified Platform: Databricks provides an end-to-end solution for GenAI, from data management to deployment and monitoring.
Custom Model Training: Use DBRX, a high-performance custom LLM developed by Mosaic AI, to train and deploy models with ease.
Cost-Effective & Scalable: Train custom LLMs and handle large-scale vector databases at a fraction of the traditional costs.

# Conclusion
Mosaic AI on Databricks offers a powerful, all-in-one platform to build, deploy, and scale Generative AI solutions with complete ownership over your models and data. With integrated governance, real-time data syncing, and cost-effective model training, it is ideal for enterprises looking to innovate in the GenAI space.
