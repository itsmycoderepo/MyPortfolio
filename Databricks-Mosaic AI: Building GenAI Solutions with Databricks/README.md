Check out my blogs on Databricks-Mosaic AI!
I’ve written two detailed blogs about building and deploying Generative AI (GenAI) solutions using Databricks and Mosaic AI. These blogs walk through the entire process, from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring. Check them out for a deeper dive:

# Overview
This guide provides a detailed overview of building Complete Generative AI (GenAI) solutions using Mosaic AI on Databricks platform. It integrates the power of MosaicAI's tools, enabling a complete GenAI solution from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring.

# Key Components
# 1. Data Ingestion

- Automate the ingestion of raw data (e.g., PDFs) using Databricks' Auto-loader.
- Clean and store data in Delta Tables for efficient querying and management.
- Implement Unity Catalog for secure data governance.

# 2. Vector Search

- Convert textual data into vector embeddings for semantic search.
- Use Databricks' Vector Search Index to store embeddings and enable fast similarity searches.

# 3. Model Lifecycle Management

- Track and manage models with MLflow, including experiment tracking and model versioning.
- Deploy models using MLflow Model Serving for real-time inference.

# 4. Generative AI Inferences

- Perform real-time similarity searches and use Large Language Models (LLMs) for AI-driven applications such as content generation or Q&A.
- Enable conversational AI through Databricks’ LLM Chat Endpoints.

# 5. Monitoring & Governance

- Use Lakehouse Monitoring to track pipeline performance, model health, and data quality.
- Ensure compliance and security with Unity Catalog, managing permissions and audit trails across data and models.

# Why Databricks?
Unified Platform: Databricks provides an end-to-end solution for GenAI, from data management to deployment and monitoring.
Custom Model Training: Use DBRX, a high-performance custom LLM developed by Mosaic AI, to train and deploy models with ease.
Cost-Effective & Scalable: Train custom LLMs and handle large-scale vector databases at a fraction of the traditional costs.

# Conclusion
Mosaic AI on Databricks offers a powerful, all-in-one platform to build, deploy, and scale Generative AI solutions with complete ownership over your models and data. With integrated governance, real-time data syncing, and cost-effective model training, it is ideal for enterprises looking to innovate in the GenAI space.
